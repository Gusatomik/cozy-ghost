# No multiuser support

The multi user support for ghost is desactivated. Cozy is a PERSONNAL cloud.
You can personnalize the owner user of the blog in the admin pannel. But even if ou create a new user, he will no be allowed to log in.

 - To access to the admin pannel you have to go to http://yourcozy-url.fr/#apps/blog
 - To access to blog you have to go to http://yourcozy-url.fr/public/blog


## What is Cozy?

[Cozy](http://cozy.io) is a platform that brings all your web services in the
same private space.  With it, your web apps and your devices can share data
easily, providing you
with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one
profiles you. You install only the applications you want. You can build your
own one too.
